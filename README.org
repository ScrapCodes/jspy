* spy

A simple java trace utility

* Usage

   Checkout into a directory (say /spy/).

** Change =.spy.clj=:

1. Change =:host= and =:port= to point to the remote debug session.
2. Set =:classes= to the base package of the classes to trace.
3. Optionally, change =exclude-classes= list to packages/classes you want to exclude from trace.


** Start repl: [fn:: If =bin/lein= is not executable then run: =chmod u+x bin/lein= ] 

   In the shell:

   #+begin_example
   =spy$ bin/lein repl= 
   #+end_example 

** Start spy: [fn:: Assuming you have already started the remote debug session with jvm args ~-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=<port-number>~ ]
   
   #+begin_example
   spy=> (spy)   
   #+end_example
   
** Show trace (and stop spy):

   #+begin_example
   spy=> (gui)
   #+end_example

** Exit with =Ctrl-C=.
